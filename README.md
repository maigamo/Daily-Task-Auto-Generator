- Root Directory (e.g., "DailyTasks")
  - Year Folder (e.g., "2023")
    - Month File (e.g., "10-October.md")

Each month file contains multiple daily task entries, with the latest entry at the top of the file.

### 👆 Manual Task Generation

If automatic generation is disabled or you need to recreate today's task:

1. Go to the plugin settings page and click "Add Today's Task Manually"
2. Or use the command palette (Ctrl+P) and search for "Add Today's Task"

Tasks are created using your custom template. You can use these variables:
- `{{date}}`: Current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `{{weekday}}`: Current day of the week
- `{{yearProgress}}`: Percentage of year completed
- `{{monthProgress}}`: Percentage of month completed
